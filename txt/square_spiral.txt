// The shape of the beginning spirals in the center of the image is quite interesting. They seem to first follow a more or less square-pattern like in an old TV, before they start circling.
// When I saw this image, I was wondering: The small objects the spiral is composed of: How many iterations do they need to reach the 72-cycle ? (Immediate basin in red, a bit overshooting as I merely colored it by Paint's flood fill).
// Each color (except red) represents an interval of 100 iterations to reach red, starting from 1..99 as gray, 100-199 as turquois (purple, yellow, green, brown, dark cyan, white)(left image) or 10 (right image).
// Interestingly, in the left image, each color occurs 4 times as a sequence of several consecutive objects. If using 10-intervals, each color occurs in blocks of 2 or 3.
// One could now play a number's game: 4 streaks - and 4 main components of the 72 cycle. Blocks of length 2 and 3: prime factors of the 72-cycle, but I do not know whether these are "real things" 
// or just lucky results using the (arbitrary human simple) numbers 10 and 100 or the /low zoom (actually none) I computed.
