// The polynomial [latex=inline]f(z)=z+\frac{1}{2}z^2 -\frac{1}{2}z^3[/latex] has been constructed to have a parabolic fix point at the origin (f`=1) and an attracting cycle at x=1. For this set, the TSA (after some modifications) can detect interior (see image below, immediate basin of the parabolic fix point in yellow).
