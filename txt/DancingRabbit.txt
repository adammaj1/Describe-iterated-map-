// This image shows the Julia set for a certain parameter in the quadratic family. It was created in response to a request by Professor Brandon Taylor (Ruskin School of Fine Art, Oxford and University of Southampton) 
// for an image that would illustrate self-similarity of Julia sets.
// The parameter c = -1.12 + 0.222i was chosen in the "dancing rabbits" component; i.e., the period 6 hyperbolic component bifurcating from the period 2 component of the Mandelbrot set. This choice was to create a distinctive subset of the Julia set that is clearly repeated at  
// different scales. In addition, the choice was made to choose the multiplier to be non-real and with modulus close to 1, to create the distinctive "spiralling" structure near the repelling period two cycle, which again can be seen repeated throughout the Julia set.
// The image was drawn using a general-purpose heuristic that estimates the distance to the Julia set using the size of the derivative and the distance to the beta-fixed point.
